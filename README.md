# bad apple on python terminal using braille codes

my second python project.
just uploaded on github to save it, the braille converting code is working fine, but it shakes up and down a lot when i run this...

1. get the bad apple video file/python codes
2. use getframe.py to extract frames from the video
3. activate bapple.py when ur ready
4. it shoud start printing bad apple in the terminal
/press space bar if u want it to stop
